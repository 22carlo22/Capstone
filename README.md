The primary objective of the project was to develop a centralized infrastructure for managing a smart office environment using an embedded system and an Android mobile application. The system's main goal was to improve communication, organizational efficiency, and productivity in the workplace, placing a key emphasis on smart project management features. This included developing tools for managers to create projects, assign tasks, and track progress , while also ensuring accessibility from both desktop and mobile platforms. The project also focused on creating role-specific views for managers and employees and supporting practical resource organization, such as scheduling meetings, booking conference rooms, and reserving hotdesks.

The provided code is the Android application, in which I played a key role in backend integration.
